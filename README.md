# Hadoop
### Data Storage

After data ingestion, the next step is to store the extracted data. The data either be stored in HDFS or NoSQL database (i.e. HBase). The HDFS storage works well for sequential access whereas HBase for random read/write access.

### Data Processing

The final step in deploying a big data solution is the data processing. The data is processed through one of the processing frameworks like Spark, MapReduce, Pig, etc.

### What is fsck?
fsck stands for File System Check. It is a command used by HDFS. This command is used to check inconsistencies and if there is any problem in the file. For example, if there are any missing blocks for a file, HDFS gets notified through this command.

# Hive 
it look likes a SQL language for generating MapRedicue Code

```
Put files into HDFS:
$ hadoop fs â€“put *site.xml /u01/bigdatasql_config/bigdatalite
Copy a file from local file system to a directory in HDFS
$ hadoop fs -copyFromLocal A.text Hadoop_Dci/A.txt
```

#### CMD commands to run and test the Kafka
```
 zookeeper-shell.bat localhost:2181 ls /brokers/ids
 kafka-topics.bat --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test
 kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test
 kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning
 # localhost:9092 is Kafka Address
 # if we open two CMD windows and run the Producer and Consumer comand in each of them we can see wen a data put to producer the consumer shows it by a delay
 kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning --property print.timestamp=true --partition 0
 kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe
 
 # output:
 Topic: test     PartitionCount: 1       ReplicationFactor: 1    Configs: min.insync.replicas=1,segment.bytes=1073741824
        Topic: test     Partition: 0    Leader: 0       Replicas: 0     Isr: 0

# HBase
#### Summary Hbase Logical Model
Row: Keys lexicographically sorted byte
Cell: 
 - Columns name are byte[]
 - Values are byte[]
 ACID guarantees per row for HBase reads and writes
